Inji Wallet enables users to securely download their verifiable credentials (VCs) directly onto their mobile devices. As part of this process, verification occurs to ensure the authenticity and validity of the credentials. Once verified, the VCs are securely stored using the deviceâ€™s hardware-based secure keystore, ensuring that the credentials are protected from unauthorized access.

## [**Data Backup**](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-wallet/functional-overview/features#data-backup-and-restore)

Inji Wallet offers a robust data backup feature, allowing users to protect their verifiable credentials by securely backing them up in either Google Drive (for android) or iCloud (for iOS devices). This ensures that even in the event of a device loss or replacement, users can easily restore their credentials and continue using them without re-verifying their identity with issuers.

## [**SSO Login**](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-wallet/functional-overview/features#streamlined-sso-and-user-controlled-authentication)

Inji Wallet supports Single Sign-On (SSO), simplifying the authentication process by allowing users to log in using their existing credentials from trusted identity providers. This eliminates the need to manage multiple credentials and provides a seamless experience when accessing or sharing verifiable credentials across platforms.

## [**Offline Sharing (BLE-based)**](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-wallet/functional-overview/features#sharing-verifiable-credentials-without-the-internet)

Inji Wallet offers a seamless way to share the trusted data as verifiable credentials without internet connection, but through BLE-based (Bluetooth Low Energy) sharing. For added security, users must complete decentralized face verification for presence assurance during offline interactions, ensuring the rightful owner is sharing their credentials.
